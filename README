Pseudo-Universal Turing Machine
-------------------------------

This project was done for a class, and it emulates a very basic turing machine, using a very simple programming language.

The interpreter continually iterates through the instructions, which are either entered manually or read from a file (.tur files).

It stops when either the stack pointer has reached the end of the input data, or it has recieved the "STOP" instruction.

I have no idea if this really qualifies as a turing machine in any way, but hey, my project, my rules.
